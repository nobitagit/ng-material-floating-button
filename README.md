ng-material-floating-button
========================

Material design floating action button implemented as an Angularjs directive. 

Made to be semantic, fast and easy to customize.
~~Shamelessly~~ inspired by action buttons from Google Inbox, Evernote and Path.

##Demo##
Head over to the project [homepage](http://nobitagit.github.io/ng-material-floating-button/) to see it in action.


**Other versions**
- [Vanilla html](https://github.com/nobitagit/material-floating-button) (original, upstream version of the component)

##How to use##
Download the whole repo directly here on Github or clone it, then (optionally) run `npm install` to have access to the configured Grunt tasks.

Docs are still in the works (and coming soon), for the time being look in the `src` folder for usage examples.

To run the tests run either `grunt karma` or `karma start test/karma.conf.js`.
